DAVS block instructions:
1.	Connect the positive port of the block to the model as a supply voltage.
2.	Connect the negative port to the ground.
3.	Provide the charge/discharge input current (A) in the block dialog box as an input parameter.
4.	Initialize the cell parameters in the model using file provided with the block library.
5.	You can change the value of the parameters according to your required cell parameters.
6.	Provide pre-defined simulation time of 9984 seconds, to simulate the model through discharge, rest, charge, and rest cycle.
